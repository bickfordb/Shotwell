Mariposa (name TBD)
===================

This is a media player for Mac OS X designed to meet my needs.  These needs mostly consist
of the following: efficiently handling large collections (ie. more than 5000 albums), sharing, discovering, playing to an Airport Express.

Features:

 * Automatically scanning changed paths quickly
 * Cover art
 * RAOP (Airport Express) support
 * Javascript web plugin API
 * Sharing via HTTP API/Bonjour
 * Does not prompt you upgrade with an onerous license agreement on every minor point release 
 * FREE SOFTWARE
