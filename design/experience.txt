Try to expose as many operations as possible through keyword search and URLs
Avoid odd filtering experiences like the iTunes artist/album filter tables.  It requires keyboard/mouse coordination to unselect items/groups of items.  A user is likely only interested in one artist/album at a time so it doesn't make sense to constantly offer a list of choices.   
Display history
Use breadcrumbs to navigate through collections.  E.g. Local Library -> Artists -> Atlas Sound -> Parallax
